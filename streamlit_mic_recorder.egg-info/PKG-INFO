# streamlit-mic-recorder

Streamlit component that allows to record mono audio from the user's microphone, and/or perform speech recognition directly.

## Installation instructions

```sh
$ pip install streamlit-mic-recorder
```

## Usage instructions

Two functions are provided (with the same front-end):

1.
```python
audio=mic_recorder(
    start_prompt="Start recording",
    stop_prompt="Stop recording", 
    just_once=False,
    use_container_width=False,
    callback=None,
    args=(),
    kwargs={},
    key=None
)
```
Renders a button. Click to start recording, click to stop. Returns None or a dictionary with the following structure:
```python
{
    "bytes":audio_bytes, # wav audio bytes mono signal, can be processed directly by st.audio
    "sample_rate":sample_rate, # depends on your browser's audio configuration
    "sample_width":sample_width, # 2
    "id": id # A unique timestamp identifier of the audio
}
```
sample_rate and sample_width are provided in case you need them for further audio processing.

Arguments:
- 'start/stop_prompt', the prompts appearing on the button depending on its recording state.
- 'just_once' determines if the widget returns the audio only once just after it has been recorded (and then None), or on every rerun of the app. Useful to avoid reprocessing the same audio twice.
- 'use_container_width' just like for st.button, determines if the button fills its container width or not.
- 'callback': an optional callback being called when a new audio is received
- 'args/kwargs': optional args and kwargs passed to the callback when triggered

Remark:
When using a key for the widget, due to how streamlit's component API works, the associated state variable will only contain the raw unprocessed output from the React frontend, which was not very practical.
For convenience I added a special state variable to be able to access the output in the expected format (the dictionary described above) more easily. If `key` is the key you gave to the widget, you can acces the properly formatted output via `key+'_output'` in the session state.
Here is an example on how it can be used within a callback:

```python
def callback()
    if st.session_state.my_recorder_output:
        audio_bytes=st.session_state.my_recorder_output['bytes']
        st.audio(audio_bytes)

mic_recorder(key='my_recorder', callback=callback)
```


2.
```python
text=speech_to_text(
    language='en',
    start_prompt="Start recording",
    stop_prompt="Stop recording", 
    just_once=False,
    use_container_width=False,
    callback=None,
    args=(),
    kwargs={},
    key=None
)
```
Renders a button. Click to start recording, click to stop. Returns None or a text transcription of the recorded speech in the chosen language.
Similarly to the mic_recorder function, you can pass a callback that will trigger when a new text transcription is received, and access this transcription directly in the session state by adding an '_output' suffix to the key you chose for the widget.

```python
def callback()
    if st.session_state.my_stt_output:
        st.write(st.session_state.my_stt_output)

speech_to_text(key='my_stt', callback=callback)
```

## Example

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_mic_recorder import mic_recorder,speech_to_text

state=st.session_state

if 'text_received' not in state:
    state.text_received=[]

c1,c2=st.columns(2)
with c1:
    st.write("Convert speech to text:")
with c2:
    text=speech_to_text(language='en',use_container_width=True,just_once=True,key='STT')

if text:       
    state.text_received.append(text)

for text in state.text_received:
    st.text(text)

st.write("Record your voice, and play the recorded audio:")
audio=mic_recorder(start_prompt="⏺️",stop_prompt="⏹️",key='recorder')

if audio:       
    st.audio(audio['bytes'])
```
